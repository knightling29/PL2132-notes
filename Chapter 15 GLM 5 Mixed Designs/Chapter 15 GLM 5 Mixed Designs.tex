Mixed designs like other factorial designs, requires at least 2 independent variable, but you can have more complex scenarios (e.g. 2 independent measure, one repeated measure, two repeated, one independent etc).

Mixed designs are still using a linear model, but it is a more complicated version. 
Mixed designs still uses ANOVA style model. 

\section{Assumptions in mixed designs}
All assumptions in beast of bias still applies, assumption of homogeneity of variance and sphericity applies as well. If we want to ignore sphericity, we can just use the Greenhouse-Geisser correction.
